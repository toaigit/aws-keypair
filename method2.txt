You can also do the following:
1.  Generate your key pair using ssh-keygen
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -q -N "" -f toai_id_rsa
    This will genrate toai_id_rsa.pub and toai_id_rsa file.
2   Run the terraform commands (terraform init, plan, apply) with the following tf file
resource "aws_key_pair" "mykey" {
  key_name   = "key-tf"
  public_key = file("toai_id_rsa.pub")
  }
